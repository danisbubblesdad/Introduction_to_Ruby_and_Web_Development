5. Which of these two classes has an instance variable and how do you know?

class Fruit
  def initialize(name)
    name = name
  end
end

class Pizza
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

===========================================================================

The Pizza class has the instance variable @name. The "@" symbol indicates an
instance variable and the Fruit class does not have this symbol.

We can also instatiate each class and run the "instance_variables" method
on each instantiation. This method would tell us all instance variables
are included in the object.

hot_pizza = Pizza.new("cheese")
hot_pizza.instance_variables ==> [:@name]

orange = Fruit.new("apple")
orange.instance_variables ==> [] (None)
