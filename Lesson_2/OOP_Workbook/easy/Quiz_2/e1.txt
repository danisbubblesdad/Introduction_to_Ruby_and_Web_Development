1. You are given the following code:

    class Oracle
      def predict_the_future
        "You will " + choices.sample
      end

      def choices
        ["eat a nice lunch", "take a nap soon", "stay at work late"]
      end
    end


What is the result of calling

    oracle = Oracle.new
    oracle.predict_the_future

======================================================================

Answer:

===>  oracle = Oracle.new creates a new instance of the Oracle class
===>  oracle.predict_the_future outputs a random string from the array within
      the choices method. IE "You will take a nap soon."
