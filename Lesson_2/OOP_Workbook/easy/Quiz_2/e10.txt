10. What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? Think of
as many as you can.


There are many benefits.

One of the most beneficial items is that OOP allows us to use DRY principles
more readily. It also allows us to compartmentalize items so that fixes are
easier to identify and do not need to be made in multiple places.

Another aspect is simply structure and organization.
The code is much easier to read, debug, and enhance using OOP methodology
rather than a procedural methodology.

This same organization and structure allows programmers to re-use code in
different projects. Code becomes much more "bolt on" in OOP vs. Procedural.
