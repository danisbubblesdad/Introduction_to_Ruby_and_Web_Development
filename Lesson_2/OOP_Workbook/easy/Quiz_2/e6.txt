6. If I have the following class:

    class Television
      def self.manufacturer
        # method logic
      end

      def model
        # method logic
      end
    end

Question:
Which one of these is a class method (if any) and how do you know?

Answer:
We can tell that self.manufacturer is the class method because, in Ruby,
Class methods start with self.

Question:
How would you call a class method?

Answer:
One needs to call the class method on the class name. In the above
example, the appropriate entry would be Television.manufacturer.
