If we have a class such as the one below:

    class Cat
      @@cats_count = 0

      def initialize(type)
        @type = type
        @age  = 0
        @@cats_count += 1
      end

      def self.cats_count
        @@cats_count
      end
    end


Explain what the @@cats_count variable does and how it works. What code would you need to write to test your theory?

============================================================================

Answer:

cats_count is a class variable that tracks how many times the class has been
instantiated. Each time a new class object is created, the counter increases
by one.

I would test my theory in IRB by instantiating X number of classes and then calling the method "cats_count" on the Cat class. IE, Cat.cats_count. The
value produced in IRB should equal the "X" number of classes that were
instantiated.
