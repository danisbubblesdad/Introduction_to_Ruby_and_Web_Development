9. What would happen if we added a play method to the Bingo class, keeping in
   mind that there is already a method of this name in the Game class that the
   Bingo class inherits from.

          class Game
            def play
              "Start the game!"
            end
          end

          class Bingo < Game
            def rules_of_play
              #rules of play
            end
          end
===============================================================================

Answer:

The play method added to the Bingo class would override the play method from
the parent Game class. We know this because if we run the ancestors method
on the Bingo class, we see that it searches for methods in Self first, and
then moves on to the parent class next.
