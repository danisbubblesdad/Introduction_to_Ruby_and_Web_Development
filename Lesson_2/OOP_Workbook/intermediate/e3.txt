3. In the last question Alyssa showed Alan this code which keeps track of items for a shopping cart application:

        class InvoiceEntry
          attr_reader :quantity, :product_name

          def initialize(product_name, number_purchased)
            @quantity = number_purchased
            @product_name = product_name
          end

          def update_quantity(updated_count)
            quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0
          end
        end

Alan noticed that this will fail when update_quantity is called. Since quantity is an instance variable, it must be accessed with the @quantity notation when setting it. One way to fix this to change attr_reader to attr_accessor.

Is there anything wrong with fixing it this way?

==============================================================================

This fix will correct the issue, but we need to ask ourselves if this is really
the change that we want to make. We are effectively giving direct get/set
privileges to both variables. Maybe we only want to give direct get/set access
to the quantity?
