1. How do we create an object in Ruby? Give an example of the creation of an
object.

A:

Since object are created from classes, they are created by storing class
instances within variables. IE dan = String.new would create a new variable
named dan that stores a blank String class.

Additionally, one could create their own class. For example,

class Human
end

dan = Human.new

This would create a new instance (object) of the Human class named dan.

2. What is a module? What is its purpose? How do we use them with our classes?
Create a module for the class you created in exercise 1 and include it properly.

A:

A module is used to store and share behaviors across classes. We invoke a
module by using the "include" reserved word within a class.

Example:

module Say
  def say(words)
    puts "=> #{words}."
  end
end

class ShoutingWords
  include say
end

loud_man = ShoutingWords.new

loud_man.speak("AHHHHHHHHHH")     # => AHHHHHHHHHH
